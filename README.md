Download market data from Finance's API

Here is a sample Python program that demonstrates how to download market data from a free finance API:

This program sends a GET request to the API endpoint with the specified headers and parameters. The symbol parameter specifies the ticker symbol of the stock for which you want to retrieve market data, and the start_date and end_date parameters specify the range of dates for which you want to retrieve data.

The API will return a JSON object with the market data for the specified ticker symbol and date range. The program prints this data to the console.

Note that you will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own API key, which you can obtain by signing up for an API account on the finance website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

import requests

# Specify the URL of the API endpoint
url = "https://finance.api.com/market-data"

# Set the request headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Set the request parameters
params = {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "start_date": "2022-01-01",
    "end_date": "2022-01-31"
}

# Make the request to the API
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Print the data
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    # Print the error message
    print(response.text)
